function [ SCs, speed_binned, activity_binned, sde_activity_binned, speed_score, n_thresh, p_thresh ] = Speed_Cells(data, floating, lap_times)
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
% SPEED_CELLS Determines which cells are speed cells.
%
%   Inputs:
%   data: a structure containing the processed data.
%   floating: a structure containing the floating speed data.
%   lap_times: a 2D array containing the lap times.
%
%   This function determines which cells are speed cells using the method
%   introduced in Kropff et al. 2015, with a slight adjustment to compare
%   each cell to its own null distribution instead of the total
%   distribution. It computes the mean and standard error of the activity
%   for the binned speed, and then finds the speed cells.
%
%   Outputs:
%   SCs: a vector containing the indices of the speed cells.
%   speed_binned: a vector containing the binned speed data.
%   activity_binned: a 2D array containing the binned activity data.
%   sde_activity_binned: a 2D array containing the standard error of the binned activity data.
%   speed_score: a vector containing the speed score for each cell.
%   n_thresh: a vector containing the lower threshold for each cell.
%   p_thresh: a vector containing the upper threshold for each cell.
%
%   Example:
%       [SCs, speed_binned, activity_binned, sde_activity_binned, speed_score, n_thresh, p_thresh] = 
%       Speed_Cells(data, floating, lap_times)
